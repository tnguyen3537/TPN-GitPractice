Exercise 14: How you can find out the names and addresses of the remote repositories of a Git project?

We can use the command git remote -v

The output is something like:
origin  https://github.com/tnguyen3537/TPN-GitPractice.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/tnguyen3537/TPN-GitPractice.git (push)
